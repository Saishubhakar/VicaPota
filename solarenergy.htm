            Solar panel array facing the sun captures the sun energy, converts it
            into electricity to give uninterrupted power supply. With the help of
            inverter, the DC power generated from the solar array is converted to AC
            power. The loads operate as per the requirement of the end user and
            surplus, if any is fed to the grid.That means when your solar panels
            produce electricity, it goes first to powering the lights, appliances
            and electronics in your office/ home. If your solar power system
            produces more electricity than you need, the extra electricity gets
            delivered back to the utility grid. If your solar power system produces
            less electricity on cloudy days, the required power is automatically
            supplied from the utility grid.

            SOLAR POWER SYSTEMS (Solar power Systems off grid) Solar power systems
            are designed for use in any place, under whatever the situation where
            good quality power is needed. Specially, these have the potential to
            provide uninterrupted power for all areas where security and safety are
            priorities. Solar power packs work on their own, independent of
            conventional power supply.

                 we operate under OPEX / BOOT model (Build, Own, Operate and
                Transfer) and deliver a 100% integrated Solar Power as a Service
                (SPAAS) detailed below:
              </div>
    
              <div class="bootpoints solarmaininfo">
                1) &nbsp; &nbsp; We set up on-site solar power plants (on rooftops, as carports, on grounds and/or on superstructures). These plants integrate seamlessly with the customer’s existing grid and/or DG system.
  
                <br></br>
  
                2) &nbsp; &nbsp; The solar plants are set up entirely on our own cost and are also maintained by us throughout the project term.
  
                <br></br>
  
                3) &nbsp; &nbsp; We enter into a long term (15-25 years) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with our customers. At the end of the PPA term, the plant is transferred free of cost (usually INR 1) to the customer.
  
                <br></br>
  
                4) &nbsp; &nbsp; The electricity price for solar power is agreed for the entire PPA period at the beginning of the agreement. This price is always lower than the existing grid tariff, ensuring guaranteed and continuous savings to the customer throughout the term of the PPA.
  
                <br></br>
  
                5) &nbsp; &nbsp; We do the end-to-end delivery of the plant from designing, procurement, installation, commissioning and operation & Maintenance.
  
                <br></br>
  
                6) &nbsp; &nbsp; We ensure that our solar plant has a 99%+ Up-time.
  
                <br></br>
  
                7) &nbsp; &nbsp; We bill our customers every month on the basis of actual energy generated by the solar plant. This ensures that the entire performance risk is borne by us as we only get paid for what we generate.
  
                <br></br>
  
                8) &nbsp; &nbsp; We undertake stiff plant performance targets and agree to compensate the customer if such targets are not met.
